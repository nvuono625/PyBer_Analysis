# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
Ridesharing services have quickly gained popularity and have been rivaling traditional ride services, especially taxis. Ridesharing services are more convenient and rider friendly than that of traditional ride services. For business logistics, it is important to build metadata through market analysis that identifies consumer behavior and economic trends to properly provide services in varying cities based off these factors. For this analysis, Pyber is the ridesharing company.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to calculate and interpret the ride counts and driver count in three types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural) and how it affects the fares for each city. Charts and graphs are created to visualize this data to understand areas of needed growth to improve the overall ridesharing experience for PyBer customers. 

## Results
### Overview of City Types
A bubbled scatter chart was developed to conceive the relationship between city type and the total number of rides per city, the total number of drivers per city and the average fare per city. The size of the bubble corresponds to driver count per city.

### Ride Counts by City Type
For ride counts by city type, a box-and-whisker plot and a pie chart was developed. In the box-and-whisker plot, you will notice an outlier for urban cities, this is the city with 39 rides. For each city, urban, suburban, and rural, the average rider count was 24.6, 17.36, 6.94, respectively. When this data is applied to the pie chart it conveys ride counts for each city into percentage of total rides. Urban’s percentage is 68.4%, suburban is 26.3%, and rural is 5.3%.

### Driver Counts by City Type
For driver counts by city type, a box-and-whisker plot and a pie chart was developed as well. In the box-and-whisker plot, there are no outliers. The average shows a count of 36.68 for urban, 13.71 for suburban, and 4.30 for rural. When this data is applied to the pie chart it conveys driver counts for each city into a percentage of total drivers. Urban’s percentage is 80.9%, suburban is 16.5%, and rural is 2.6%

### Fare Counts by City Type
For fare counts by city type, a box-and-whisker plot and a pie chart was once again developed. In the box-and-whisker plot, there are no outliers. The average fare is of $36 for urban, $25 for suburban, and $31 for rural. When this data is applied to the pie chart it conveys fares for each city into a percentage of total fares. Urban’s percentage is 62.7%, suburban is 30.5%, and rural is 6.8%

### Total Fares by City Type
For total fares by city type, a multiple-line graph was developed to show total weekly fares for each city type. Urban cities have the highest revenue, higher than suburban, which is are both higher than rural.

## Summary:
Based on the results of this analysis, a few recommendations can be made to address disparities found amongst the city types:

1. Focusing the data on the full years as opposed to just January to the end of April.
2. Expanding analysis to distinguish between age groups, gender groups, racial/ethnics groups so that the company can cater towards each group.
3. For any company to be successful, it needs to prioritize customer relations so strengthening that relationship can be beneficial. (i.e. rewards programs)
